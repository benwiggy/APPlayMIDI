# APPlayMIDI
A simple MIDI file player for MacOS.

Ever since Apple deprecated the 32-bit QuickTime framework in favour of the newer AVKit, the Mac's flagship media player, QuickTime Player has refused to play MIDI files. (Despite the file type being associated with the app.)

The AVKit framework contains a perfectly good player for MIDI files: AVMIDIPlayer, so there's no excuse for not having an app that plays MIDI files.

The app contains one other feature: it can Copy the MIDI data from a document to the clipboard, so it can be pasted into apps that support pasting MIDI data.
